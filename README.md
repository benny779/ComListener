# ComListener

Connect to serial devices, send and receive answers.\
I'm using the [RJCP.IO.Ports](https://www-0.nuget.org/packages/SerialPortStream/) library to support Usb-Serial devices.

As of today, this project supports these device models:
* [H650 Baby and Neonatal Scales](https://www.shekelonline.co.il/wp-content/uploads/HW-650.pdf).
* [Healthweighâ„¢ Ultrasonic Physician BMI Scale - H120](https://www.hmed.com.hk/uploads/originals/Shekel%20Ultrasonic%20Physician%20BMI%20Scale.pdf).
